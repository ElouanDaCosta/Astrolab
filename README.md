- Built with **Wails** for native desktop experience
- **React** + **TypeScript** for the frontend development
- Support for multiple database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Database query editor
- Data viewing and editing capabilities
- Customizable and modern UI

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started

To get started with the Astrolab frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astrolab-frontend.git
cd astrolab-frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Run the development server:**

```bash
wails dev
```

This will start the Wails application with the React frontend in development mode.

4. **Build the application for production:**

```bash
wails build
```

This will build the production-ready desktop application.

## Technologies Used

- **Wails**: Enables native desktop apps using Go with a modern frontend.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **TailwindCSS** (optional): For rapid UI development with utility-first CSS.
